# Clone Driving Behavior with Deep Learning

Overview
---
In this project, using  deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. It will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

Using image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
To do this project, you will need Python 3 along with the following libraries, as well as Jupyter Notebook installed.
```
> pip install keras  
> pip install matplotlib 
> pip install numpy  
> pip install pickle  
> pip install sklearn  
> pip install cv2  
> pip install tensorflow
```

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py

The simulator can be downloaded from the following.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument `run1` is the directory to save the images seen by the agent to. If the directory already exists it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp when the image image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Create a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be name of the directory following by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

The video will run at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
